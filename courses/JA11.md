<summary> 1. Synchronous Code </summary>
<br>
Synchronous Code: Code that is executed line by line in the order that it appears. Each line of code waits for the previous line to finish executing before it is executed. This is the default behavior of JavaScript. Most of the code we have written so far is synchronous code. It has a disadvantage ie Long-running operations block code execution which means that it has to wait for long codes to keep finish running before the next line is executed.
  <br>

```Javascript
// Synchronous Code
    const p = document.querySelector('.p');
    p.textContent = 'I am Josh!';
    alert('Text set!');
    p.style.color = 'red';
  ```
    
The `alert` is a example of the long-running operation. It blocks the code execution until the user `clicks` the OK button. This is a problem because the user cannot do anything else on the page until the `alert` is closed.<br>
This maybe fine but in cases for example where execution has to wait for a 5 second timer to finish running before the next line of code is executed, it becomes a problem. <br>

<summary> 2. Asynchronous Code Intros</summary>
<br>
Asynchronous Code: Code that is  executed line by line in the order that it appears. Each line of code does not wait for the previous line to finish executing before it is executed. <br>

```Javascript
// Asynchronous Code
    const p = document.querySelector('.p'); // The first line is still synchronous and we move on to the next line
    setTimeout(() => { // Here we encounter the Timeout function which will basically starts a timer in an asynchronous way. So this means that the timer will essentially run in the background without affecting the main code. We also register a callback function which will be called as soon as the timer is finished. This callback function will be called by the web API and not by the main code. 
      p.textContent = 'I am Josh!';
    }, 5000); // The main code is not been blocked by the timer. It continues to run and the next line of code is executed. This is called non-blocking code.
    p.style.color = 'red';
```
Asynchronous programming is about coordinating the behaviour of a program over a period of time.<br>
As seen in the example we need a callback function to execute an asynchronous code. But that does not mean that callback functions automatically make code asynchronous.

```Javascript
[1,2,3].map(v=>v*2); // This accepts a callback function but it is still synchronous
```

Only certain functions are asynchronous like `setTimeout` and we just have to know which ones are and aren't<br>
N.B: Callback functions alone do *NOT* make code asynchronous!

<summary> 3. Asynchronous Code Examples </summary>
<br>

```Javascript
const img = document.querySelector('.dog-img'); // This is a synchronous code
img.src = 'dog.jpg';  // This is a synchronous code - But, here we set the src attribute of any image is asynchronous as it is set in the background by the browser. The browser will download the image in the background and then set the src attribute. This is an asynchronous code.
img.addEventListener('load', function() { // Listening for the load event which is fired as soon as the image is loaded. This is an asynchronous code. As all this code is 'non-blocking' and will run in the background without affecting the main code.
  img.classList.add('fadeIn');
});
// Since we are listening once it is ready it joins the event loop and waits for the event to happen. Once the event happens the callback function is called and the code is executed.
p.style.width = '500px';
```

N.B: `addEventListener` does *NOT* automatically make code asynchronous! for example:

```Javascript
const img = document.querySelector('.dog-img');
img.addEventListener('click', function() {
  img.classList.add('fadeIn');
});
```
This is a synchronous code because the callback function is only called when the user `clicks` on the image. So the callback function is only called when the event happens. This is not asynchronous code because the code is not running in the background. It is only running when the event happens. It is simply waiting for an `event` to happen but it is not doing anything<br>

Now what makes the first example asychronous is simply the fact that the image is loaded asychronously in the background and not because we are listening for the `load` event. So the code is running in the background and it is not blocking the main code. <br>

other examples of asynchronous code include: `Geolocation API`, `AJAX` (This is probably the most important usecase of asynchronous JavaScript) <br>

More examples from my personal research includes - `Fetch API`, `Web Workers`, `IndexedDB`, `File API`, `Application Cache`, `Web Sockets`, `Server-Sent Events`, `Service Workers`, `Promises`, `Async/Await` etc. <br>

<summary> 4. AJAX and APIs </summary>
<br>

AJAX: Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. Allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way. This means that we can request data from web servers dynamically and then use that data to update the page without reloading the page. <br>

Say we have a client and we want to get some data from the server. We can do this by sending a request to the server. The server will then process the request and send back a response. This is called the `request-response cycle`.
