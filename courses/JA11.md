<summary> 1. Synchronous Code </summary>
<br>
Synchronous Code: Code that is executed line by line in the order that it appears. Each line of code waits for the previous line to finish executing before it is executed. This is the default behavior of JavaScript. Most of the code we have written so far is synchronous code. It has a disadvantage ie Long-running operations *block* code execution which means that it has to wait for long codes to keep finish running before the next line is executed.
  <br>

```Javascript
// Synchronous Code
    const p = document.querySelector('.p');
    p.textContent = 'I am Josh!';
    alert('Text set!');
    p.style.color = 'red';
  ```
    
The alert is a example of the long-running operation. It blocks the code execution until the user clicks the OK button. This is a problem because the user cannot do anything else on the page until the alert is closed.<br>
This maybe fine but in cases for example where execution has to wait for a 5 second timer to finish running before the next line of code is executed, it becomes a problem. <br>

<summary> 2. Asynchronous Code </summary>
<br>
Asynchronous Code: Code that is  executed line by line in the order that it appears. Each line of code does not wait for the previous line to finish executing before it is executed. <br>

```Javascript
// Asynchronous Code
    const p = document.querySelector('.p'); // The first line is still synchronous and we move on to the next line
    setTimeout(() => { // Here we encounter the Timeout function which will basically starts a timer in an asynchronous way. So this means that the timer will essentially run in the background without affecting the main code. We also register a callback function which will be called as soon as the timer is finished. This callback function will be called by the web API and not by the main code. 
      p.textContent = 'I am Josh!';
    }, 5000); // The main code is not been blocked by the timer. It continues to run and the next line of code is executed. This is called non-blocking code.
    p.style.color = 'red';
```
Asynchronous programming is about coordinating the behavior of a program over a period of time.<br>
N.B: Callback functions alone do *NOT* make code asynchronous!
