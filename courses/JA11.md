<summary> 1. Synchronous Code </summary>
<br>
Synchronous Code: Code that is executed line by line in the order that it appears. Each line of code waits for the previous line to finish executing before it is executed. This is the default behavior of JavaScript. Most of the code we have written so far is synchronous code. It has a disadvantage ie Long-running operations block code execution which means that it has to wait for long codes to keep finish running before the next line is executed.
  <br>

```Javascript
// Synchronous Code
    const p = document.querySelector('.p');
    p.textContent = 'I am Josh!';
    alert('Text set!');
    p.style.color = 'red';
  ```
    
The alert is a example of the long-running operation. It blocks the code execution until the user clicks the OK button. This is a problem because the user cannot do anything else on the page until the alert is closed.<br>
This maybe fine but in cases for example where execution has to wait for a 5 second timer to finish running before the next line of code is executed, it becomes a problem. <br>

<summary> 2. Asynchronous Code Intros</summary>
<br>
Asynchronous Code: Code that is  executed line by line in the order that it appears. Each line of code does not wait for the previous line to finish executing before it is executed. <br>

```Javascript
// Asynchronous Code
    const p = document.querySelector('.p'); // The first line is still synchronous and we move on to the next line
    setTimeout(() => { // Here we encounter the Timeout function which will basically starts a timer in an asynchronous way. So this means that the timer will essentially run in the background without affecting the main code. We also register a callback function which will be called as soon as the timer is finished. This callback function will be called by the web API and not by the main code. 
      p.textContent = 'I am Josh!';
    }, 5000); // The main code is not been blocked by the timer. It continues to run and the next line of code is executed. This is called non-blocking code.
    p.style.color = 'red';
```
Asynchronous programming is about coordinating the behaviour of a program over a period of time.<br>
As seen in the example we need a callback function to execute an asynchronous code. But that does not mean that callback functions automatically make code asynchronous.

```Javascript
[1,2,3].map(v=>v*2); // This accepts a callback function but it is still synchronous
```

Only certain functions are asynchronous and they are usually functions that start with a prefix like setTimeout. we just have to know which ones does or doesn't<br>
N.B: Callback functions alone do *NOT* make code asynchronous!

<summary> 3. Asynchronous Code Examples </summary>
<br>

```Javascript
const img = document.querySelector('.dog-img'); // This is a synchronous code
img.src = 'dog.jpg';  // This is a synchronous code - But, here we set the src attribute of any image is asynchronous as it is set in the background by the browser. The browser will download the image in the background and then set the src attribute. This is an asynchronous code.
img.addEventListener('load', function() { // Listening for the load event which is fired as soon as the image is loaded. This is an asynchronous code. As all this code is 'non-blocking' and will run in the background without affecting the main code.
  img.classList.add('fadeIn');
});
// Since we are listening once it is ready it joins the event loop and waits for the event to happen. Once the event happens the callback function is called and the code is executed.
p.style.width = '500px';
```

N.B: addEventListener does *NOT* automatically make code asynchronous! for example:

```Javascript
const img = document.querySelector('.dog-img');
img.addEventListener('click', function() {
  img.classList.add('fadeIn');
});
```
This is a synchronous code because the callback function is only called when the user clicks on the image. So the callback function is only called when the event happens. This is not asynchronous code because the code is not running in the background. It is only running when the event happens. It is simply waiting for an event to happen but it is not doing anything<br>
