+ DEVELOPER SKILLS & EDITOR SETUP

<details>
<summary> 1. Setting Up Prettier and VSCode </summary>
<br>
Installing Node.js and NPM

1. Go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download the LTS version
2. Install it
3. Open your terminal and type the command below to check if it is installed

```bash
node -v
```

4. You should see the version of node installed
5. Now type the command below to check if npm is installed

```bash
npm -v
```

6. You should see the version of npm installed
7. That's it! for installing node and npm

The setup for prettier is pretty simple, just follow the steps below:

1. Install the Prettier extension in VSCode
2. Go to File > Preferences > Settings
3. Search for "Auto Save" 
4. Set to "On FocusChange"
5. Search for default formatter
6. Select Prettier
7. Search for "Prettier: Single Quote"
8. Check the box
9. Search for "Prettier: Semi"
10. Check the box
11. Search for "Prettier: Arrow Parens"
12. Check the box
13. That's it! for prettier setup

Now for the VSCode setup, follow the steps below:

1. Install the Live Server extension in VSCode using the command below:

```bash
npm install -g live-server
```

2. Theme: Monokai Pro or One Monokai
3. Font: Fira Code (My personal preference) because it has ligatures
4. Icons: Material Icon Theme (My personal preference)
5. Settings: Go to File > Preferences > Settings and search for "Font Ligatures" and check the box
6. Settings: Go to File > Preferences > Settings and search for "Font Family" and set it to "Fira Code"
7. Settings: Go to File > Preferences > Settings and search for "Font Size" and set it to "16" for legibility
8. Settings: Go to File > Preferences > Settings and search for "Tab Size" and set it to "2" for legibility
9. Settings: Go to File > Preferences > Settings and search for "Format On Save" and check the box

There are also hosts of extensions that you can install to make your life easier, but I will leave that to you to explore. I will list some of them below: 

1. Bracket Pair Colorizer (I don't use this as I find it distracting with the colors)
2. Quokka.js (I use this for testing my code but it gives errors for things fetched from the DOM like document.querySelector) 
3. Live Server (I don't use this as I prefer to use the live-server npm package)
4. Intellicode (I use this for autocompletion as it is better than the default VSCode autocompletion when it comes to JavaScript)
5. Commit Message Editor (I use the form generated by this extension to write my commit messages from time to time to conform to the conventional commit standard)

These are just a few and I am no expert in VSCode extensions ðŸ¤—, so I will leave the rest to you to explore.

<summary> 2. Using Google, StackOverflow and MDN </summary>
<br>
Google is your friend, so use it. StackOverflow is also your friend, so use it. MDN is the most important of all as according to Jonas as time goes on you will need to visit Documentations to work with external libaries so spending time there will help you a lot. This is the best advice I can give you. I will leave you with a quote from Jonas Schmedtmann: "The best developers are the best googlers". So, use Google, StackOverflow and MDN. That's it! ðŸ¤—

```JavaScript
// PROBLEM 1:
// We work for a company building a smart home thermometer. Our most recent task is this: "Given an array of temperatures of one day, calculate the temperature amplitude. Keep in mind that sometimes there might be a sensor error."

const temperatures = [3, -2, -6, -1, 'error', 9, 13, 17, 15, 14, 9, 5];

// 1) Understanding the problem
// - What is temp amplitude? Answer: difference between highest and lowest temp
// - How to compute max and min temperatures?
// - What's a sensor error? And what do do?

// 2) Breaking up into sub-problems
// - How to ignore errors?
// - Find max value in temp array
// - Find min value in temp array
// - Subtract min from max (amplitude) and return it

const calcTempAmplitude = function (temps) {
  let max = temps[0];  // This is sets the value of max to the first element in the array which is 3
  let min = temps[0]; // This is sets the value of min to the first element in the array which is 3

  for (let i = 0; i < temps.length; i++) { // This is a for loop that loops through the array
    const curTemp = temps[i]; // This sets the value of curTemp to the current element in the array
    if (typeof curTemp !== 'number') continue; // This checks if the current element is not a number and if it is not a number it skips it and continues to the next element

    if (curTemp > max) max = curTemp; // This checks if the current element is greater than the value of max and if it is greater than the value of max it sets the value of max to the current element
    if (curTemp < min) min = curTemp; // This checks if the current element is less than the value of min and if it is less than the value of min it sets the value of min to the current element
  }
  console.log(max, min); // This logs the value of max and min to the console which is 17 and -6 respectively 
  return max - min; // This returns the difference between the value of max and the value of min
};
const amplitude = calcTempAmplitude(temperatures); // This calls the calcTempAmplitude function and passes the temperatures array as an argument and stores the returned value in the amplitude variable
console.log(amplitude); // This logs the value of amplitude to the console which is 23

// PROBLEM 2:
// Function should now receive 2 arrays of temps

// 1) Understanding the problem
// - With 2 arrays, should we implement functionality twice? NO! Just merge two arrays

// 2) Breaking up into sub-problems
// - Merge 2 arrays

const calcTempAmplitudeNew = function (t1, t2) { // This is a function call that receives two arrays as arguments but the function is not implemented to handle two arrays
  const temps = t1.concat(t2); // This merges the two arrays into one array and stores it in the temps variable. This is the ability of 'concat' to merge two arrays into one array
  console.log(temps); // This logs the value of temps to the console which is [3, -2, -6, -1, 'error', 9, 13, 17, 15, 14, 9, 5, 9, 0, 5]

  let max = temps[0]; 
  let min = temps[0];

  for (let i = 0; i < temps.length; i++) { 
    const curTemp = temps[i]; // This sets the value of curTemp to the current element in the array
    if (typeof curTemp !== 'number') continue; // This checks if the current element is not a number and if it is not a number it skips it and continues to the next element

    if (curTemp > max) max = curTemp;
    if (curTemp < min) min = curTemp;
  }
  console.log(max, min);
  return max - min;
};
const amplitudeNew = calcTempAmplitudeNew([3, 5, 1], [9, 0, 5]); // This is two arrays being passed as arguments to the calcTempAmplitudeNew function
console.log(amplitudeNew);
```

<summary> 3. Debugging with the Console and Breakpoints </summary>
<br>

```JavaScript
const measureKelvin = function () { // This is a function declaration
  const measurement = {// This is an object
    type: 'temp', // This is a property
    unit: 'celsius',

    // C) FIX
    // value: Number(prompt('Degrees celsius:')),
    value: 10,
  };

  // B) FIND
  console.table(measurement);

  // console.log(measurement.value);
  // console.warn(measurement.value);
  // console.error(measurement.value);

  const kelvin = measurement.value + 273; // This adds 273 to the value of measurement.value and stores it in the kelvin variable. This means that object properties can be used in calculations
  return kelvin;
};
// A) IDENTIFY
console.log(measureKelvin());

// Using a debugger
const calcTempAmplitudeBug = function (t1, t2) {
  const temps = t1.concat(t2);
  console.log(temps);

  let max = 0;
  let min = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < temps.length; i++) {
    const curTemp = temps[i];
    if (typeof curTemp !== 'number') continue;

    if (curTemp > max) max = curTemp;
    if (curTemp < min) min = curTemp;
  }
  console.log(max, min);
  return max - min;
};
const amplitudeBug = calcTempAmplitudeBug([3, 5, 1], [9, 4, 5]);
// A) IDENTIFY
console.log(amplitudeBug);

```

<summary>  Coding Challenge  </summary>
<br>

```JavaScript
// Coding Challenge #1

/*

/*
Given an array of forecasted maximum temperatures, the thermometer displays a string with these temperatures.

Example: [17, 21, 23] will print "... 17ÂºC in 1 days ... 21ÂºC in 2 days ... 23ÂºC in 3 days ..."

Create a function 'printForecast' which takes in an array 'arr' and logs a string like the above to the console.

Use the problem-solving framework: Understand the problem and break it up into sub-problems!

TEST DATA 1: [17, 21, 23]
TEST DATA 2: [12, 5, -5, 0, 4]
*/


// 1) Understanding the problem
// - Array transformed to string, separated by ...
// - What is the X days? Answer: index + 1

// 2) Breaking up into sub-problems
// - Transform array into string
// - Transform each element to string with ÂºC
// - Strings needs to contain day (index + 1)
// - Add ... between elements and start and end of string
// - Log string to console

const data1 = [17, 21, 23];
const data2 = [12, 5, -5, 0, 4];

console.log(`... ${data1[0]}ÂºC ... ${data1[1]}ÂºC ... ${data1[2]}ÂºC ...`);

const printForecast = function (arr) {
  let str = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    str += `${arr[i]}ÂºC in ${i + 1} days ... `;
  }
  console.log('...' + str);
};
printForecast(data1);

```
